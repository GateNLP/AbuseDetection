## Evaluation

Existing gazetteer-based abuse classification performance is 0.78 (Cohenâ€™s Kappa: 0.37), with a precision of 0.61, a recall of 0.44 and an F1 0.51 on the Kaggle data. From [ICWSM paper](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM18/paper/viewFile/17861/17060). Though note that the gazetteer approach wasn't constructed from the Kaggle data, which is more US English.
